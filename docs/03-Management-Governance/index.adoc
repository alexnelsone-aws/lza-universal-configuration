= Management and Governance

The LZA Universal Config delivers a comprehensive, ready-to-deploy Management and Governance framework that solves the complex challenges organizations face when establishing and maintaining secure, compliant multi-account AWS environments. Built upon years of AWS Professional Services experience and real-world customer implementations, this solution reduces the guesswork for choosing infrastructure baselines that lead to desired security and compliance-ready outcomes through pre-configured components.

Organizations adopting AWS at scale consistently struggle with establishing effective management and governance structures. These challenges include designing efficient organizational hierarchies, implementing appropriate access controls, ensuring consistent resource configurations, and maintaining security baselines across multiple accounts and regions. Without a comprehensive approach, organizations risk security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, operational inefficiencies, and increased management overhead.

The Management and Governance components of LZA Universal Config directly address these challenges by implementing AWS Well-Architected best practices and aligning with major compliance frameworks such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, Germany C5 2020, and NATO Directive D-32 (2021). The solution provides a universal configuration that establishes guardrails, standardizes account provisioning, centralizes logging, and enables comprehensive backup strategies—all through declarative configuration rather than complex custom development.

By implementing the LZA Universal Config, organizations can reduce cloud foundation setup time from months to days, decrease security and compliance risks through standardized controls, and enable operational teams to focus on business value rather than infrastructure management.

== AWS Environment

The LZA Universal Config delivers a production-grade AWS environment and organizational structure that aligns with AWS's multi-account strategy best practices.

=== AWS Organizations Configuration - link:../../modules/base/default/organization-config.yaml[organization-config.yaml]

AWS Organizations forms the foundation of effective multi-account governance in the LZA Universal Config. Rather than leaving organizational design as a complex exercise, the LZA Universal Config delivers a pre-designed structure aligned with AWS best practices and years of enterprise implementation experience. This well-architected structure establishes the framework for security controls, enables consistent policy enforcement, creates clear boundaries between environments, and simplifies permissions management—all while preventing the fragmented security postures and inconsistent controls that typically plague manual implementations.

==== Organizational Units - `organizationalUnits`

The LZA Universal Config implements a carefully designed OU structure following best practices defined in the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/recommended-ous-and-accounts.html[Organizing Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts] whitepaper. OUs in this model are strategic control points that determine an account's purpose, security posture, and applicable guardrails—not just administrative containers. By focusing on permission boundaries rather than mirroring organizational structure, this approach allows your AWS environment to scale efficiently while maintaining consistent governance across all accounts.



When deploying LZA with the LZA Universal Configuration, you do not need to pre-create any organizational units. LZA will create and manage all OUs defined in this configuration file. After you start using LZA, it's critical that all organizational unit management happens through LZA configuration updates rather than through the AWS Management Console or other methods. Creating or modifying OUs outside of LZA will cause the LZA pipeline to fail until you update your configuration files to match your organizational structure.

Many other capabilities in the LZA Universal Configuration depend on proper OU definition as a prerequisite, including account creation within OUs, defining custom Service Control Policies (SCPs), or applying specific backup policies to resources within an OU.

A typical enterprise architecture approach envisions that most major applications, groups of workloads, or teams will work across a set of dedicated AWS accounts provisioned across different functional OUs (Dev, Test, Prod). As new teams or major applications are onboarded to AWS, they will be provided with this group of new AWS accounts. This approach provides strong segregation and isolation both between stages in the SDLC cycle and between different workloads or teams.

===== Security OU

The Security OU serves as the control center for security operations across your entire AWS environment, housing the Audit and LogArchive accounts required by AWS Control Tower. The LZA Universal Config places these accounts here to establish centralized security monitoring, governance, and compliance capabilities that would be impossible to achieve with distributed security resources. This structure facilitates segmentation and least privilege principles between security and workload operations and enables consistent security policy enforcement for security related resources. The Security OU should not contain application workloads, maintaining the strict separation of duty required by most compliance frameworks.

===== Infrastructure OU

The Infrastructure OU forms the operational backbone of your AWS environment by centralizing critical shared services like networking, perimeter security, and common utilities. The LZA Universal Config defines this OU to contain the accounts aligned to Networking and common infrastructure used by the Workload OU accounts.  The networking and perimeter accounts in this OU reduce network fragmentation, connectivity inconsistencies, and infrastructure duplication that typically plague multi-account environments. By housing specialized accounts for these foundational services, this design standardizes connectivity patterns, simplifies troubleshooting, and reduces attack surface through consistent security controls. The LZA Universal Config also applies protective SCPs to prevent accidental modification of critical resources like Transit Gateways and shared VPC configurations—addressing one of the most common causes of enterprise cloud outages.

===== Suspended OU

The Suspended OU creates a secure containment zone for accounts that have been decommissioned or require temporary isolation such as during account provisioning, addressing a critical security gap in AWS account lifecycle management. By implementing a comprehensive DenyAll SCP, this structure prevents all API operations in contained accounts, preserving historical data for compliance while providing maximum protection against unauthorized activity. This approach simplifies account lifecycle management and creates a secure holding area for accounts during security investigations or organizational restructuring.

===== Workloads OU

The Workloads OU creates a hierarchical structure for business applications that aligns with the software development lifecycle, establishing clear boundaries between infrastructure and application environments. The LZA Universal Config implements this structure to address the common challenges of inconsistent security controls across development stages and difficulties in implementing progressive governance. By organizing accounts into sub-OUs representing distinct lifecycle phases (Sandbox, Dev, Test, Prod), this design creates a structured progression of security controls that match application maturity while enabling unified governance policies. This approach simplifies account provisioning, facilitates appropriate compliance controls at each stage, and provides clear isolation between environments—all while supporting efficient cost attribution and organizational scaling.

====== Sandbox
The Sandbox OU provides isolated environments for experimentation, learning, and proof-of-concept development. This OU typically has the most permissive policies of the workload environments, allowing developers and cloud practitioners to explore AWS services and build skills in a contained environment. While providing greater flexibility, the Sandbox OU still enforces fundamental security guardrails through SCPs to prevent exposed credentials, unencrypted data, or uncontrolled spending. 

Sandbox accounts are typically network-isolated from other accounts within the organization—they are not connected to VPCs hosting development, test, production, or shared workloads, nor do they have on-premises network connectivity. Resources in the Sandbox OU should never contain sensitive data or production workloads.

====== Dev
The Dev (Development) OU houses accounts used for the initial building and development of applications and services. Dev environments typically implement stronger controls than Sandbox environments but allow more flexibility than Test or Production. This OU provides the primary working environment for development teams while enforcing organizational standards for security and compliance. 

The Dev OU often contains sensitive data and workloads, hosting development tools and line-of-business applications that are in active development. External access for these accounts is provided via the Perimeter account rather than direct internet connectivity. Dev environments may have connectivity to shared services but maintain restricted access to production resources and data to ensure appropriate separation.

====== Test
The Test OU contains accounts used for formal validation, quality assurance, and user acceptance testing. This environment closely mirrors the Production configuration with additional instrumentation for testing and validation. The Test OU implements stricter controls than Dev environments to ensure testing occurs in conditions that closely match production.

Test accounts typically contain sensitive data and workloads similar to production but in a controlled testing context.  This environment is critical for validating both application functionality and infrastructure changes before they reach production systems.

====== Prod
The Prod (Production) OU contains accounts that host business and mission-critical applications and services for business operations. This OU implements the strictest security controls, change management processes, and access restrictions. Production accounts typically have enhanced monitoring, more aggressive backup schedules, and stricter network controls than other environments.

Accounts in the Prod OU are ideally locked down with only specific Operations and Security personnel having access. Due to the critical nature of these workloads, changes to Production accounts and resources should require additional approval steps and formal change management processes.

=== Home Region and Region Selection - link:../../modules/base/default/global-config.yaml[global-config.yaml]

One of the most powerful capabilities of Landing Zone Accelerator is its ability to help you manage a multi-region, multi-account environment consistently and efficiently. Most AWS services are regional in nature, meaning they must be configured independently in each region where you operate. Using LZA to manage configurations across regions significantly reduces the complexity and risk of misconfiguration that often occurs with manual, region-by-region administration.

The LZA Universal Configuration provides two key settings in the `global-config.yaml` file to control region management:

* `homeRegion`: Defines the primary AWS region where the LZA pipeline is deployed and from which cross-region resources are managed. This region serves as the central control point for your multi-region deployment and houses critical components like AWS Control Tower and Organizations management. The home region typically should be the region where you expect to have the highest concentration of resources or that best meets your latency, compliance, and disaster recovery requirements.

* `enabledRegions`: Specifies the list of AWS regions where LZA will deploy and manage resources. LZA will only configure services and resources in the regions listed in this array. This controlled approach to region enablement helps prevent resource sprawl and ensures that your organization maintains governance over cloud resource deployment.

Best practices for region management through LZA include:

1. Regions should be enabled through LZA Universal Configuration and through the AWS Console Control Tower. This ensures that proper security controls, logging, and governance mechanisms are automatically deployed to newly enabled regions.

2. When adding a new region, update the `enabledRegions` array in the configuration file rather than manually enabling services in that region. This allows LZA to handle the configuration of all necessary baseline services and security controls in the new region.

3. Consider regulatory, data residency, service availability, and latency requirements when selecting regions to enable.

4. Limit enabled regions to only those necessary for your business operations to reduce the security footprint and management overhead.

5. The home region should typically be enabled first, followed by additional regions as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying the home region after initial deployment is a complex operation that requires careful planning and execution. It is recommended to establish the home region during initial setup and maintain it throughout the lifecycle of your environment.
====

=== Control Tower - link:../../modules/base/default/global-config.yaml[global-config.yaml]

AWS Control Tower is a required foundation for the LZA Universal Configuration deployment and serves as the core service for establishing and managing a well-architected multi-account AWS environment. Control Tower provides the guardrails, account provisioning capabilities, and centralized governance that form the basis of the Landing Zone Accelerator's enhanced functionality.

The `controlTower` section in the `global-config.yaml` file configures how LZA interacts with AWS Control Tower:

* `landingZoneVersion`: Specifies the Control Tower landing zone version deployed in your environment. This setting should reflect the current version of Control Tower that you're running or want to deploy if you are deploying with LZA. AWS periodically releases updates to Control Tower that introduce new features and capabilities. For detailed information on Control Tower versions and updates, refer to the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/configuration-updates.html[AWS Control Tower Configuration Updates] documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to have Control Tower already set up before implementing the LZA Universal Configuration. One of the key advantages of using LZA is that it will enable and set up Control Tower for you as part of its deployment process. This is the simplest approach for organizations new to Control Tower and the LZA Universal Configuration.

If you already have Control Tower deployed in your environment, LZA can either work with your existing deployment or reset/update it to align with the LZA Universal Configuration requirements. For detailed information on these scenarios, refer to the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/prerequisites.html#for-aws-control-tower-based-installation[Landing Zone Accelerator prerequisites for Control Tower-based installation] documentation.
====

==== Regional Deny Control

AWS Control Tower provides Region deny capabilities, which help enforce data residency requirements and enhance security by limiting access to AWS services and operations to specific AWS Regions. This feature is particularly important for organizations with regulatory compliance needs or those seeking to reduce their security risk profile by constraining the geographical boundaries of their AWS operations.

The Region deny feature allows you to:

* Enforce regulatory compliance by preventing resource creation in unauthorized Regions
* Reduce security risks by limiting the attack surface area
* Centralize operations in specific Regions for better management and cost control
* Implement data sovereignty requirements for sensitive information

AWS Control Tower offers two approaches to Regional deny:

* **Landing Zone Level Region Deny**: Applied broadly across your AWS Control Tower environment
* **OU Level Region Deny**: More granular control that can be applied to specific Organizational Units

For detailed information on implementing and managing Control Tower Regional Deny controls, refer to the link:../07-Operations/07-07-Control-Tower-Regional-Deny.adoc[Control Tower Regional Deny Operations Guide].

Control Tower provides several key benefits that are enhanced by the Landing Zone Accelerator:

1. **Standardized Account Provisioning**: Control Tower's Account Factory provides a consistent method for creating and configuring new accounts, which LZA then further customizes according to your configuration files.

2. **Preventative and Detective Guardrails**: Control Tower implements link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/mandatory-controls.html[mandatory guardrails] that establish baseline security controls, which LZA extends with additional governance through Service Control Policies and AWS Config Rules.

3. **Centralized Logging**: Control Tower sets up centralized logging through AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs, which LZA enhances with additional log sources and retention policies.

4. **Identity Management**: Control Tower integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) to provide centralized identity management, which LZA extends with additional IAM roles, policies and delegates Identity Center management to the SharedServices account.

Additional Control Tower settings that can be configured through LZA, such as Identity Center Access and logging configurations, are covered in their respective sections of this documentation:

* For details on Identity Center integration and access management, see the Security, Identity & Compliance section
* For information on logging configurations, see the Logging & Monitoring section

=== AWS Accounts - link:../../modules/base/default/accounts-config.yaml[accounts-config.yaml]

The LZA Universal Config delivers a comprehensive multi-account strategy that eliminates the complexity and risk associated with manual account provisioning. Without proper account structure and configuration, organizations struggle with inconsistent security controls, fragmented audit trails, inefficient resource sharing, and elevated operational risk. The LZA Universal Config addresses these challenges by implementing an infrastructure-as-code approach where all accounts are defined, configured, and governed through a single configuration file.

The account structure in LZA Universal Config is designed to promote proper separation of duties, enable fine-grained access control, and provide the foundation for operational excellence. Each account serves a distinct purpose with specific security boundaries and integrations. Unlike traditional approaches that require manual account creation and configuration—a process prone to errors and inconsistency—LZA automates the entire lifecycle, applying standardized settings and establishing the proper security controls in accounts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The LZA Universal Configuration only requires the AWS Management account to be pre-created. All additional accounts are automatically created and configured by LZA, ensuring consistent implementation of security controls, proper organizational placement, and appropriate configuration.
====

The `accounts-config.yaml` file defines two categories of accounts:

==== Mandatory Accounts - `mandatoryAccounts`

Mandatory accounts form the foundational infrastructure of the AWS landing zone and are critical for proper security, governance, and operational capabilities. The LZA Universal Config implements these accounts following best practices for separation of duties and isolation of critical functions. Each account is strategically configured with specific permissions boundaries, delegated administrative responsibilities, and integration points to create a comprehensive management framework.

===== Management Account

The Management account (organization root) is the administrative foundation of your AWS organization and where LZA itself is deployed. The LZA Universal Config establishes this account as a dedicated control plane with no business workloads, reducing the risk surface area and aligning with AWS best practices. This account hosts the AWS Organizations service, manages organizational policies, and contains the trusted automation pipelines that deploy and maintain your landing zone.

The LZA Universal Config implements strict security controls for this account, as it has privileged access to all accounts in the organization. Access to this account should be highly restricted to a minimal set of administrative personnel using strong authentication methods.

===== Audit Account

The Audit account serves as the security control center for your entire AWS environment. The LZA Universal Config automatically configures this account as the delegated administrator for critical security services, centralizing security operations while implementing proper separation of duties from the Management account. This approach aligns with compliance frameworks like NIST 800-53, which emphasize segregation of administrative functions.

The LZA Universal Config establishes this account as the delegated administrator for:

* AWS GuardDuty - For continuous threat detection
* AWS Security Hub - For security posture management and compliance monitoring
* AWS Macie - For sensitive data discovery and protection
* AWS Config - For resource configuration monitoring and compliance
* AWS IAM Access Analyzer - For permission boundary monitoring

By consolidating security administration in this account, the LZA Universal Config creates a unified security operations center with comprehensive visibility across your organization while limiting privileged access to only security personnel.

===== LogArchive Account

The LogArchive account creates a secure, immutable audit trail for your entire organization. The LZA Universal Config automatically configures this account with appropriate log collection, storage, and retention policies that align with both security best practices and common compliance requirements.

The LZA Universal Config establishes centralized logging for:

* AWS CloudTrail logs - For API activity monitoring
* AWS Config logs - For configuration change tracking
* VPC Flow Logs - For network traffic analysis
* CloudWatch Logs - For application and service monitoring
* Security service findings - For consolidated security analysis

This centralized approach eliminates the fragmented audit trails that typically plague multi-account environments while providing the comprehensive logging required for security investigations, compliance auditing, and operational troubleshooting. The LZA Universal Config also implements appropriate access controls to ensure that security personnel can analyze logs without the ability to modify them.

==== Workload Accounts - `workloadAccounts`

Workload accounts provide specialized environments for infrastructure services and business applications. The LZA Universal Config implements a carefully designed set of core infrastructure workload accounts that establish the operational foundation for your AWS environment. This architecture follows the principle of least privilege and separation of duties, ensuring that each specialized function operates with appropriate isolation while maintaining necessary integration points.

===== Network Account

The Network account establishes centralized network management for your entire cloud environment. Organizations without this centralized approach typically struggle with inconsistent connectivity patterns, fragmented security controls, and complex troubleshooting processes across multiple accounts.

The LZA Universal Config configures this account as the network hub for your organization, implementing:

* Transit Gateways with proper route configurations for controlled inter-VPC communication
* Shared VPCs (optional) with appropriate RAM sharing to workload accounts
* Centralized DNS management with Route 53 Resolver configurations
* Network monitoring and flow log collection
* Connectivity foundations for hybrid network integration

By centralizing these network components, the LZA Universal Config creates consistent, predictable network paths while simplifying administration and reducing duplication of common network resources across accounts.

===== Perimeter Account

The Perimeter account provides a secure boundary for controlled communication between your AWS environment and external networks. Without a dedicated perimeter architecture, organizations face increased attack surface, inconsistent traffic inspection, and difficulty maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

The LZA Universal Config establishes this account as your network security boundary with:

* Centralized internet ingress/egress control points
* AWS Network Firewall deployments for traffic inspection
* DDoS protection through AWS Shield
* Centralized VPN and Direct Connect endpoints

This architecture creates a security-focused boundary that enables comprehensive traffic inspection, centralized policy management, and consolidated logging of external communications—all critical capabilities for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting compliance requirements.

===== SharedServices Account

The SharedServices account allows customers to deliver common infrastructure services across your organization. Without this centralized approach, organizations typically experience inconsistent service implementations, increased management overhead, and higher costs due to service duplication.

The LZA Universal Config configures this account as the operations center for your AWS environment, implementing:

* AWS IAM Identity Center (as delegated administrator) for centralized identity management

This account can be further configured to support:

* Directory services for integrated authentication and authorization
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) centralized certificate management for consistent TLS implementations
* Shared patching and maintenance services
* License management and software distribution

This centralized services model reduces operational overhead, ensures consistent implementation of critical infrastructure components, and provides a unified approach to managing common services that would otherwise be duplicated across multiple accounts.

[NOTE]
====
The LZA Universal Config is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add application workload accounts in the appropriate functional OUs (Dev, Test, Prod) as your organization's needs grow. The configuration provides standardized templates for these additional accounts, ensuring they inherit the proper security controls and connectivity based on their organizational placement.
====

==== Account Level Security Settings

The LZA Universal Config automatically applies critical security settings to all accounts at creation time, establishing consistent security baselines without manual intervention. This comprehensive approach addresses common security gaps that occur when account-level settings are managed individually, leading to inconsistent protection and potential compliance violations.

Key security settings automatically configured include:

* *S3 Public Access Block* - Prevents inadvertent exposure of S3 buckets and objects
* *Default EBS Volume Encryption* - Ensures all EBS volumes are automatically encrypted
* *Default S3 Bucket Encryption* - Ensures all S3 buckets encrypt data by default
* *IMDSv2 Requirement* - Enforces more secure instance metadata service access
* *GuardDuty, Security Hub and Macie Enablement* - Provides comprehensive security monitoring
* *AWS Config Recording* - Enables configuration monitoring and compliance assessment

These settings create a strong security foundation across all accounts in your AWS organization, implementing defense-in-depth principles through automated, consistent controls. By applying these settings through LZA Universal Config rather than manual processes, organizations eliminate configuration drift and ensure that all accounts maintain the same high standard of baseline protection.

== Tagging - link:../../modules/base/default/organization-config.yaml[organization-config.yaml]

Resource tagging is critical for effective cloud governance, but organizations routinely struggle with inconsistent tag implementation, tag value drift, and difficulties enforcing standardization across large environments. Without a structured tagging strategy, organizations face challenges with cost allocation, ownership identification, automated operations, and compliance tracking. These issues compound in multi-account environments where different teams may implement conflicting tagging approaches.

The LZA Universal Config addresses these challenges by implementing a comprehensive tagging governance framework through AWS Organizations Tag Policies. This approach centralizes tag definition and enforcement, ensuring consistent metadata across your entire AWS environment while enabling powerful automation capabilities including the backup strategy described in the previous section.

=== Tag Policies - `taggingPolicies`

Traditional tagging approaches rely on voluntary compliance with standards, leading to inconsistent implementation and limited usefulness of tags for operational purposes. The LZA Universal Config solves this through AWS Organizations Tag Policies that define and enforce standardized tagging practices from a central control point.

Tag policies in LZA Universal Config specify which tag keys are required, what values are acceptable, and which resources must implement specific tags. This ensures that critical operational tags like `BackupPlan` maintain consistent formatting and values across all accounts. The configuration defines these policies in JSON files that are attached to specific OUs, creating a hierarchical enforcement model that can be tailored to different parts of your organization.

The LZA Universal Config implements two complementary tag policies that work together to create a consistent backup selection framework:

==== Organization Tag Policy (`OrgTagPolicy`)

The Organization Tag Policy establishes governance over the `BackupPlan` tag for core infrastructure resources, ensuring standardized backup selection across accounts. Without this policy, organizations typically face inconsistent backup schedules, resource protection gaps, and difficulties identifying which recovery strategy applies to specific resources.

The policy enforces that when resources are tagged with `BackupPlan`, the value must be one of the approved backup frequencies: `Hourly`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Monthly`. This standardization enables automated backup selection and prevents configuration errors that could lead to inappropriate backup frequencies for critical resources.

This policy applies to the following resource types across both Infrastructure and Workloads OUs:

* EC2 instances - For compute workload protection
* EBS volumes - For persistent storage protection 
* DynamoDB tables - For NoSQL database protection
* Amazon EFS file systems - For shared file system protection
* Amazon FSx file systems - For specialized file system protection
* AWS Storage Gateway resources - For hybrid storage protection

By implementing this policy at the OU level, the LZA Universal Config ensures that both infrastructure services and business applications follow the same tagging standards, creating consistency across your entire AWS footprint.

==== S3 Tag Policy (`S3TagPolicy`)

The S3 Tag Policy addresses the unique continuous backup capabilities of Amazon S3. Organizations without this specialized policy often struggle with inconsistent approaches to S3 data protection and inability to leverage S3-specific backup features.

This policy enforces that S3 buckets tagged with `BackupPlan` must use one of the approved values: `Continuous`, `Hourly`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Monthly`. The inclusion of the `Continuous` value enables point-in-time recovery for S3 data, a capability not available for most other resource types.

This specialized policy complements the Organization Tag Policy, ensuring that S3 buckets across both Infrastructure and Workloads OUs follow the same standardized approach while accommodating S3-specific capabilities.

=== Effective Tagging Strategy

The integrated tagging governance in the LZA Universal Config transforms what is often an inconsistent manual process into a powerful automation enabler. This approach offers significant advantages over traditional tagging approaches:

1. *Operational Automation* - Tags drive automated processes including backups, cost allocation, and resource management
2. *Clear Resource Ownership* - Consistent tagging establishes responsibility for resources, simplifying operational handoffs
3. *Fine-Grained Cost Control* - Standardized tags enable accurate cost allocation and financial management
4. *Automated Compliance* - Tags can identify resources subject to specific compliance requirements
5. *Simplified Resource Lifecycle* - Tags can drive automated resource scheduling, scaling, and retirement

The integration between tag policies and backup functionality creates a seamless approach where resource owners simply need to apply the appropriate tag value to include their resources in the corresponding backup plan. This puts control in the hands of those who best understand resource criticality while maintaining centralized governance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tag policies enforce format and values but do not automatically apply tags to resources. To maximize the effectiveness of the tagging strategy, organizations should:

* Incorporate tagging requirements in infrastructure as code templates
* Implement CI/CD pipeline checks that verify proper tagging
* Configure AWS Config rules to identify non-compliant resources
* Establish regular compliance reporting for tagging status
* Create automated remediation for untagged or incorrectly tagged resources
====

[TIP]
====
While the LZA Universal Config implements backup-focused tag policies, this framework can be extended to include additional business-critical tags:

* *Environment* (`dev`, `test`, `prod`) - For deployment context and selective automation
* *Owner* (team or individual identifier) - For operational responsibility and communication
* *Application* (application identifier) - For service mapping and dependency tracking
* *Compliance* (`pci`, `hipaa`, `gdpr`) - For regulatory scope identification
* *Confidentiality* (`public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`) - For security controls
====
